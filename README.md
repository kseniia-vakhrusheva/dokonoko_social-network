## Description
This project is a dynamic web application built using React.js for the UI and Redux for BLL, providing users with a seamless and responsive experience.

## Technologies Used

1. **React.js:** The project utilizes React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for modular development, making it easier to manage complex UI elements and enhance reusability.

2. **Redux:** Redux is employed for state management, ensuring a predictable and centralized state container for the application. Actions trigger state changes through reducers, maintaining a clear data flow and enabling efficient handling of user interactions.

3. **Routing:** React Router is used for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different views and components within the application. Route-based code splitting may be implemented to optimize loading times and improve performance.

4. **CSS Modules:** CSS Modules are used for styling components, providing scoped and modular CSS that enhances maintainability and prevents style conflicts.

5. **API Integration:** The project interacts with backend services via RESTful APIs to fetch and manipulate data. Axios or Fetch API may be utilized for handling HTTP requests, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend layers.
